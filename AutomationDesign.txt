Requirement: The automation requirements are given below .

Feature: Verify wish list feature and the lowest price item to cart  
  
   Scenario: Add four items to the wishlist and add lowest of them to cart  
    Given I login to "https://testscriptdemo.com/"
    Given I add four products to my wishlist 
    When I view my whishlist table 
    Then I find total four selected items in my wish list  
    When I search for lowest price product
    And I am able to add the lowest price item to the cart 
    Then I am able to verify the item in the cart   
 
Design: The framework is designed using Java / Selenium / Cucumber / BDD using Page object design pattern and object oriented methodology. 
I have created a page file with all the required locators that will be used to carry out the action on the pages. 
A page action file is created to perform the required user actions as per the requirement. 
The test execution is done in chrome browser; however the framework can be extended to any browser after adding the dependencies.
I have created a runner file with Testng framework to run the test cases. 
Config.properties file is used to pass the url and browser details. 

Positive elements of the design: The frame work is scalable, we can add more page files and action file as per the requirement and expand the coverage.

Improvements: 
Reporting and logging mechanism will need to be improved.
In case any exceptions during execution , webdriver close is not implemented , it needs to be improved.   

How to Run the Project : 

1) Run tsdrunner.java using Testng.
